# Let’s Go for a Drive: Exploring AI’s Societal Impact in K-8 Education with an Interactive Self-Driving Car Tool
This is an interactive tool designed to educate students on the societal impacts and ethical considerations of artificial intelligence (AI). Through a self-driving car simulation, students learn how AI models are trained using data to make decisions and the importance of diverse and representative data. The tool also encourages discussions about the broader implications of AI in everyday life.

Tool can be accessed from [ML4Kids Scratch Platform](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/scratch/?url=https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/api/scratch/fd99d1a0-b7ea-11ed-85e0-25577ec38ffce200e355-1890-4bae-9ae2-89d51a1e2999/extension3.js).

## Setup and Usage Guide

### Step 1: Set Up the Environment
1. Visit the our extensiable of [ML4Kids Scratch Platform](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/scratch/?url=https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/api/scratch/fd99d1a0-b7ea-11ed-85e0-25577ec38ffce200e355-1890-4bae-9ae2-89d51a1e2999/extension3.js).

### Step 2: Download the Project File
1. Download the `.sb3` file provided with this repository.
2. Upload the `.sb3` file to the Scratch platform by selecting "File" > "Load from your computer" in the Scratch editor.

### Step 3: Run the Simulation
1.  Once the file is uploaded, you can start the simulation by clicking the green flag on the Scratch-GUI interface.
2. We recommend exploring the tool by selecting the models incrementally—starting with model 1, then moving to model 2, and finally model 3.
3. Observe how each model handles the three obstacles (traffic cones, animals, pedestrians) to understand how AI decisions influence the outcomes in a self-driving car scenario.
